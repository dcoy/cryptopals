These are my solutions to the Cryptopals cryptography challenges in Crystal. Solutions are written out at length to show thought process - there are almost certainly more efficient ways of solving each challenge, so don't use mine as a model.

Why Crystal? I like Ruby and have always wanted to work with Crystal.

Don't look in this project if you don't want to see the solutions. If you're going through the challenges, seek help in other ways before looking at completed problems.

I'm not affiliated with Cryptopals and did not create any of these challenges myself, and I'm only including challenge texts themselves so that I can have a local copy to work from offline. Original challenges and more info can be found on the [Cryptopals site](https://cryptopals.com/).
